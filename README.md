# Mobile Application Development in Android Studio
This repository contains the code for the project titled "Mobile Application Development in Android Studio". In this project, an android application to calculate the cost and quantity of certain pharmaceutical chemicals, along with the generation of a couple of certificates has been developed in Android Studio. This is a working mobile application (not released on any app store) that has been created exclusively for the company "Dr. Hemang's Laboratory" as part of a two-month internship from January 30, 2021, to March 30, 2021.

The project also made use of Google Firebase to store the company data and retrieve it for calculations/display within the application. The repository also contains a walkthrough of the application in the form of a video.
